  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I recently switched from an iPhone to Android, and discovered shortly thereafter that my phone number was still associated with iMessage, meaning that any time someone with an iPhone tried texting me, I’d receive nothing, and they’d get a “Delivered” receipt in their Messages app as though everything were working as expected.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of a day trying to fix the problem on my own (mostly because Apple’s support tries to extort $20 from you unless you have a device with an active support plan), and eventually succeeded in getting my phone number removed from my Apple ID.</p>

<p>Great! But not, because it didn’t change anything. I’m still not receiving text messages from anyone with an iPhone.</p>

<p>So I called up Apple tech support again, using Ellen’s new iPhone 5c as my supported device (if she can’t text me, it’s a tech support problem for her, too, I guess). After 10 minutes walking through various steps I’d already taken and others that were completely impractical (Apple Support: “Can you try deleting the contact from your new iPhone and re-adding it?” Me: “I can’t tell everyone I know to delete and re-add me as a contact.”), my tech support person told me that I was breaking up, and that she needed to call me back.</p>

<p>I hung up; she called me back, then explained:</p>

<p>This is a problem a lot of people are facing.
The engineering team is working on it but is apparently clueless as to how to fix it.
There are no reliable solutions right now — for some people the standard fixes work immediately; many others are in my boat.
In the meantime, Apple has completely hijacked my text messaging and my phone number portability (portability between devices, not networks). No one can fix this but Apple because it’s a problem at the device level, which means people in my position have no recourse but to wait for Apple to figure out what the problem is. But Apple isn’t offering any public support on the issue that I’ve been able to find (and it’s worth repeating that proper support is behind a $20 paywall for most people who’ve switched devices, who would also be the most commonly affected by this problem).</p>

<p>I thought iMessage was pretty novel when Apple launched it. Providers were charging an absurd mark-up on SMS delivery, and the switch between iMessage and SMS was seamless enough to be almost invisible to the user, save the green vs. blue bubbles, which are in their own way a sort of weird social/status indicator (“omg why doesn’t Nathan have an iPhone?”).</p>

<p>But if it breaks, which it apparently has, it means Apple has crippled an entire medium for communication. Most of my friends have iPhones. My phone number hasn’t changed. But my number is now a black hole for text messages.</p>

<p>Update: If you’re wondering, here are most of the supposed solutions I’ve tried with no success.</p>

Everything I’ve tried to stop my texts from disappearing into iMessage</p>

<p>I’ve gotten many, many helpful emails and tweets with tips for how to fix my iMessage purgatory problem (people are great). Unfortunately, I’ve already tried everything that people have suggested (so far, at least).</p>

<p>For the record, I still have my old iPhone, so I can easily swap the SIM card back into it and perform common fixes. Here are at least a few of the things I’ve tried:</p>

<p>Reset my Apple ID password
Turn off iMessage in the Settings app
Log out of Messages and FaceTime on all my devices
Text STOP to 48369
Remove my device from My Support Profile (https://supportprofile.apple.com/)
The phone number in question is not associated with my Apple ID anymore. If I log into my Apple account in the Messages setting, that number doesn’t show up as a send/receive option. But on the iDevices of my friends and family, that number still appears to be associated with iMessage.</p>

<p>If you’ve got a suggestion I haven’t listed above, let me know! I’ve tried a lot over the past week, so I’m sure there are a couple I’ve forgotten about. I’m also not including terrible solutions, like “have everyone you know delete you as a contact and re-add you” or “have everyone you know delete all previous conversations with you.” Incidentally, I’ve tried these things on Ellen’s phone and she still can’t send me a text.</p>

<p>Update: I was able to fix the problem on a per-phone basis by doing the following:</p>

<p>Open Settings &gt; Messages.
Toggle iMessage to Off.
Send a text to the black-hole number. (It should send as SMS.)
Turn iMessage back on in Settings &gt; Messages.
Of course, the only phone I have access to is Ellen’s, and I’m not about to ask all of my contacts to do this. At least now Ellen can text me, but that’s nothing close to a solution.</p>

<p>(I’ll try to update this with any new fixes worth mentioning — and hopefully, eventually, one that works.)</p>

And then I was like …</p>

<p>And then I was like </p>

<p>Three months ago, Ellen and I soft-launched And then I was like, a web app that lets you make animated gifs with your webcam. Our basic goals were to:</p>

<p>Make something fun.
Try our hands at working together on a project.
Work with some interesting new technologies.
Seed the world with more than the same warmed-over gallery of gifs that make the rounds on tumblr, reframing the gif as a more participatory medium.
I learned a lot from building the site, and then quite a bit more after launching it. This week I took what I learned from how people were using it, did a lot of this:</p>

<p>fast typing</p>

<p>…and released an update to And then I was like focused on better/faster gif-making.</p>

<p>Since it launched, I’ve tried four or five different methods for optimizing how the gifs are made and saved, focusing primarily on a workflow that creates gifs as quickly as possible. I’m now using a great JavaScript library called gif.js to convert the individual frames to a gif on the client side (using web workers), and as a result the process of converting and saving a gif is about ten times faster than at launch (from about 15-20 seconds to 2 seconds or less).</p>

<p>I’ve also streamlined the process from visiting the site to making a gif. You’re never prompted to sign in (though you can still log in and associate your gifs with an account if you want to).</p>

<p>When you’re making a gif — in addition to changing the way gifs loop — you can now adjust playback speed (see speedy-typing gif above).</p>

<p>Last, if you’ve got an Android phone, you can make gifs in Chrome for Android using your phone’s camera.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in giving it a try, it’s just one click away (no login required). If you’ve got feedback, please don’t hesitate to share.</p>

<p>I want to make a gif!</p>

Joel’s Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup</p>

<p>Last year I read a post by Joel Spolsky regarding startup equity on Stack Overflow’s now-defunct startup site and found it to be helpful. While looking for the post earlier today to send to a friend, I learned that the site’s since been discontinued. Luckily the good people at SO offer a data dump of all the Qs and As from their discontinued sites, so I was able to hunt down this particular Q and A and am republishing it here for my friend and anyone who might be interested in reading it.</p>

<p>It’s been accused of oversimplification, but if nothing else it seems like a decent starting point. So, here it is:</p>

<p>The Q</p>

<p>I have come up with an idea for a new social networking application. It’s not something I expect to be hugely successful, but I think it does have some potential. I’ve approached a few close friends and collegues, all of whom really liked the idea. A couple have offered to come on as partners to help develop the idea into a working application.</p>

<p>I cannot afford to pay them out-of-pocket for their time (nor do they expect that), and we’re all approaching this as a project we’ll do on our nights and weekends. Since I think the idea does have the potential to turn into a successful venture, I want to go ahead and solve the ownership/payment issue now before it becomes an issue. I’m leaning towards splitting ownership of the idea among the three of us, and letting that determine how any profits are split later on. Is this the right choice, and if so, what’s a fair split? I came up with the idea and have already invested quite a bit of time planning it out (plus I’m sure I’ll pay any incidental development expenses out of my pocket), so I feel like I should definitely have a larger share of the ownership. Is that reasonable?</p>

<p>I’m also trying to think of some way to reward partners based on effort. I’m not worried about someone signing on then doing nothing, but I do think it’s quite possible that one (or more) of us might obsess about the project and put in significantly more effort. If that happens, I think that person should get a proportionately larger share. Any suggestions on how to structure that?</p>

<p>The A</p>

<p>This is such a common question here and elsewhere that I will attempt to write the world’s most canonical answer to this question. Hopefully in the future when someone on answers.onstartups asks how to split up the ownership of their new company, you can simply point to this answer.</p>

<p>The most important principle: Fairness, and the perception of fairness, is much more valuable than owning a large stake. Almost everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong, and one of the biggest things that can go wrong is huge, angry, shouting matches between the founders as to who worked harder, who owns more, whose idea was it anyway, etc. That is why I would always rather split a new company 50-50 with a friend than insist on owning 60% because “it was my idea,” or because “I was more experienced” or anything else. Why? Because if I split the company 60-40, the company is going to fail when we argue ourselves to death. And if you just say, “to heck with it, we can NEVER figure out what the correct split is, so let’s just be pals and go 50-50,” you’ll stay friends and the company will survive.</p>

<p>Thus, I present you with Joel’s Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup.</p>

<p>For simplicity sake, I’m going to start by assuming that you are not going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside investors. Later, I’ll explain how to deal with venture capital, but for now assume no investors.</p>

<p>Also for simplicity sake, let’s temporarily assume that the founders all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at the same time. Later, I’ll explain how to deal with founders who do not start at the same time.</p>

<p>Here’s the principle. As your company grows, you tend to add people in “layers”.</p>

<p>The top layer is the first founder or founders. There may be 1, 2, 3, or more of you, but you all start working about the same time, and you all take the same risk… quitting your jobs to go work for a new and unproven company.</p>

<p>The second layer is the first real employees. By the time you hire this layer, you’ve got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers–doesn’t matter). These people didn’t take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn’t start the company, they joined it as a job.</p>

<p>The third layer are later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well.</p>

<p>For many companies, each “layer” will be approximately one year long. By the time your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public or whatever, you probably have about 6 layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is larger. There might be two founders, five early employees in layer 2, 25 employees in layer 3, and 200 employees in layer 4. The later layers took less risk.</p>

<p>OK, now here’s how you use that information:</p>

<p>The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. Each of the next five layers should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Two founders start the company. They each take 2500 shares. There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half.</p>

<p>They hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding.</p>

<p>They hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we’re giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up.</p>

<p>By the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively. The earliest employees who took the most risk own the most shares.</p>
